Descriptions
-------------
Board used to transmit 915MHz RF signal. MSP430 controls the amplifier output by modulation.

TxBoardDefinitions.h --> Header file for the board
Main.c --> Selects which programs are included what code to run

HARDWARE_V2 Files:
ProgramPLL.c --> Programs the PLL and transmits a CW signal on the output.


HARDWARE_V1 Files: (Outdated)
CWXmit.c --> Transmits a CW wave, but does not program the PLL
MessageXmit.c --> Transmits a message to a tag. This program is designed for Hardware_V1
TestBoard.c --> Pulses LEDs and sends out a signal and beeps a lot. Just used to make sure
    everything was soldered correctly and working.

Neither:
TryDemodFile.c --> This is actually the sister program to MessageXmit.c which is intended to be
    programmed on a tag (with an MSP430) to demodulate the message. It is not used for this board.
